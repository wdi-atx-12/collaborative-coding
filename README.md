# Pair Programming Reflection Markdown Learning




### This class is going well, nothing bad so far!
### Once we start node / python and such ill have some trouble because its fairly new to me

### this class is awesome, great teachers, great connections, great help

### I looked up a lot of pair programming last night, and I saw common problems of frustration of trying hard not to literally get impatient and take their computer and write the code yourself, if you are the driver.


#### I definitely learned new tricks with the pair programming concept, its neat, not sure if I like it but I can see how useful it is.
