# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

## Part 1

Overall I really enjoyed the pair programming activity we did today. It was fun to be able
to work to overcome a challenge with someone else, Especially because so much of our work
in the course so far has been on our own. It turns out it is easier to get past a mental block
if you have a way to talk through it with someone else. I do think my one issue with it was
that I did not always have a clear grasp on what the roles were. It was certainly hard at times
as the person typing to not interject, and as the day went along our format definitely got 
'looser' and we started just working through the solution together. I think it would be
interesting to try this activity again and try to be stricter with the role divisions.

Probably the code concept I had the hardest time talking through was anything having to do with ajax, mostly because it is so new to me. I havent had enough time going through it in my head or with others to really feel like I have a strong grasp of the terminology, and having to talk about it in a vaguer way was tricky because of that. I found myself looking up terms in order to communicate with my partner, even if I knew the syntax and structure for what I was trying to do. 

My final thought is that I thought it was interesting that people had trouble using the callback function from the html URL... that served our purposes fine, and we had no trouble putting anything on the map. It was a purposeful choice of ours to roll back to this method after our ajax call to the Google Maps API threw an error, and I thought it was interesting that we were the only people in the class who it worked for.

## Part 2

#### Articles I read:
- 'Pair Programming' on agilealliance.org
- '12 Principles of Agile Development' on agilealliance.org
- 'Pair Programming vs. Code Reviews' on codinghorror.com

I started reading about Pair programming, just because I was curious to see what industry professionals' experiences were with the practice. This led me to reading and learning about agile development, a term I have heard multiple times before but never really understood. Turns out it is exactly what it sounds like; a model for project management that embraces change and new ideas. This seems pretty cool, although the cynic in me could see plenty of situations with overzealous team leaders making the idea fairly frustrating in practice.

I think what I learned from reading this and from our activity today is how important it is for my work to consistently be written in a way that I would feel comfortable explaining to other people. I feel like I have done a fairly good job of it so far, but there are definitely some assignments over the past few weeks where I have charged through a problem without stopping too long to think about some of the intermediary steps. I think this will also be a skill I can apply later in my career, especially as projects and teams start increasing in size and scope.
