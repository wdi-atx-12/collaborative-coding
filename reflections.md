# Reflections on the Earthquake Lab

I was paired with Jesse and Gerry, both of which are experienced programmers than me. I did my best to keep up with the both of them during the 

process. It would have taken me a whole lot longer to start pulling from APIs but observing them taught me a whole lot about the process. 

The way they set up the code was really well thought out. Gerry took more of a well thought out approach while Jesse just ripped into to 

problems. At some point i was having difficulty contributing much at all because before my brain could arrive at a conclusion they had solved 

the issue. I did catch a pretty big error in our code early on but they were so deep into another part of it that I wasn't really heard when I 

spoke up. I assumed that they knew about the issue and we're just testing out some other things before wrapping up that part of the function 

they were building. Because I'm new to web development in general I lack confidence to speak up in the presence of experienced programmers. I 

learned that I should be more vocal about an issue even if I assume that they picked up on it already, because both Jesse and Gerry's minds 

were so deep in the code that they overlooked the fact that our longitude and latitude were returning the same value 87 times. It was a simple 

fix and if I had spoken up I could have saved us a little time in the end.  The entire experience got me way more familiar with ajax, jQuery, 

JSON, and Javascript

What this article taught me is that an experienced developer also learns things from being paired with a novice. Jesse mentioned that being 

paired with me was helping him explain things effectively, which was in turn solidifying familiar concepts in his mind. Going into this lab I 

was a bit worried that I was going to hinder the progress of our team, but I think everyone ended up taking a lot away from it.

And this article taught me that we maybe should have gone about the pre planning stage a little more deliberately. We just kind of jumped into 

coding without laying out in pseudo code what we were trying to accompliah, step by step. While we finished the assignment and most of the 

bonuses, it seemed our workflow could have been more organized, which would have made for less messy code and a more effiecient pace. I learned 

a lot by just seeing how Jesse and Gerry's minds work and a couple of issues about ajax and json were ironed out through the course of the lab.
