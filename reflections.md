# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

Write your reflections here using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

Tonight's homework is two parts:

1. Reflect on today's pair programming and write out your thoughts.
  - What went well? What went poorly?
  The things that went well with the paired programming was that we had another person to keep us sane.
  It was always nice having another pair of eyes on code.
  What went poorly wasn't very much to be honest. I think it could go poorly if the person you are paired with
  or working with just wasn't compatible with you personally or coding wise.

  - Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? Why?
  The code concepts that I had the hardest time talking about was the indentations and code syntax. The reason mainly
  is just because everyone has different syntax preferences. I also know that I do not have enough knowledge to explain
  the code, syntax, and indentations thoroughly. With time and experience I hope to change this.

  - Any other thoughts about the experience
  I really enjoyed paired programming and working with another peer. I thought it was really enlightening to hear someone
  else's thoughts on coding and their way of approaching a problem. I hope to do pair programming again soon.

2. Read up on a topic related to communication on a development team (e.g. pair programming, code reviews, Postmortems, etc) and write some thoughts about them
  - Which articles / blog posts did you read?
  "After 2 years of pair programming" http://sundeepgupta.ca/post/160841104851/breaking-down-successful-pair-programming

  - Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?
  High effective programmers are called 'seniors' and low effective programmers are called 'juniors'

  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately?
  You want to build the person up while pair programming. It takes a lot of patience and self empathy. Share knowledge,
  understanding, and always try to be clear when talking or explaining. 

  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?
  If I am mentoring someone, do not tell them what to right. Do not take over and type it for them.
  This is not what a good mentor does. A good mentor listens, answers questions, observe and ask leading questions.
