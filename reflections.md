# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

1. Reflect on today's pair programming and write out your thoughts.
  - What went well? What went poorly?
        - Pair programming was a great learning experience. Initially, there was a learning curve on understanding your partners coding style, the best way to give contructive criticism that is recieved well, letting go of the reins of control, as well as how to best communicate your own thought process in a productive and effective way. It was also difficult to not explicitly tell your partner what to code but instead talk through your thought process in a pseudo code-like style. After getting over that initial learning curve, tackling our project together proved to be extremely beneficial. We were able to see a different way of thinking through a project and having a second set of eyes made debugging a lot faster. 
  - Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? Why?
        - For me, it was hard to remember the correct terminology while talking through my thought process. 
  - Any other thoughts about the experience
        - I enjoyed this experience because it made me practice letting go of control as well as made me realize that I need practice communicating effectively as a programmer. 
2. Read up on a topic related to communication on a development team (e.g. pair programming, code reviews, Postmortems, etc) and write some thoughts about them
  - Which articles / blog posts did you read?
        1. https://blog.codinghorror.com/pair-programming-vs-code-reviews/
            - This website did a great job in comparing the pros and cons of pair programming vs. code-reviews.  I think ultimately, it comes down to understanding how to communicate effectively and learning how your partner best receives information in order be the most productive when pair programming or code reviews. Being able to communicate in a constructive way while also being able to recieve constructive criticism is always a great skill to have in life and programming. 
        2. https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/
            - This website did a great job in giving you best practices when you are doing code reviews. They talked about the importance of fostering a positive code review culture: "Peer review can put strain on interpersonal team relationships. It´s difficult to have every piece of work critiqued by peers and to have management evaluating and measuring defect density in your code. Therefore, in order for peer code review to be successful, it´s extremely important that mangers create a culture of collaboration and learning in peer review."

            "While it´s easy to see defects as purely negative, each bug is actually an opportunity for the team to improve code quality. Peer review also allows junior team members to learn from senior leaders and for even the most experienced programmers to break bad habits."

        4. https://blog.codepen.io/2015/01/20/033-postmortems/
            - Both these websites gave a great description on what postmortems are and how effective they are. It is kind of like a reflection at the end of your project to think about what went well and what went wrong. I think it's always a great idea to take a moment to reflect on your practice whether it be coding or tackling any goals you might have.
  - Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?
        - This is the first time I've ever heard of the terms pair programming, code reviews, and postmortems so it was great to read about the pros and cons of each as well as difficulties others have had with each. In my past jobs, I feel like I've done a form of each of these especially when you're working in a team. The key is to know who you're working with and what factors make them work well and what factors trigger bad reactions to better learn from one another. 
  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately?
        - I need to work on learning how to speak proficiently through code and effectively explore other coder's coding styles.
  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?
        - After reading about all three, I think I would feel more comfortable with pair-programming and Postmortems more than I would code reviews only because I tend not to take critisism well especially from people who don't know how to give constructive critisism well. However, I need to get comfortable in being able to effectively do all three and embrace constructive criticism in order to become a better overall programmer. Being exposed to this experience is great practice because it'll help me start understanding other coding styles/methods in order for me to give better code reviews in my future career as a web developer.
