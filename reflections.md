# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

Write your reflections here using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

### What went well? What went poorly

The experience was very productive over all. We had good communication
, and were helpful to one another in the sense of staying within
each other roles. The only time that we collaborated in logic
was if we hitted road blocks that were just not being solved at a
second crack at them. I feel like it did nothing went poorly 
it was a pretty positive experience and I think it made me a
more confident coder. Having someone to shara hypothesis with 
was very important to me in the sense of bulding more confidence 
at the time of stating them to myself.

###Which code concepts did you have the hardest talking about?why?

I feel like we built a solid on success function, made it easy to understand
the process, and easy to add more features/functinons to it.
We hit the longest snag with when implementing the earthwuake icon,
but it was matter of trial an error. After a couple of tries we were on 
the right track.

## Any other thoughts about the experience
It was a very productive experience, I felt like communication and patience 
could be paramount for a productive experience.
Basicaly if there is not a good attitude and communication 
is almost better not to start coding until the two parts are at ease 
and there's a bridge. I say this becuase I can see if there was 
no comunication how having the advantage of having two brains for 
the task can turn into a disadvantage very fast.

###Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?

There are many specific strategies that you can use to help 
with the expecience, but in the end it always comes down to 
be patience sticking to your role and having good communication.

### What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately

Working on the same level desk, two monitors, two mice, two desks.

###What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?

It just a reasurance that just making an effort on communicating 
with people always goes a long was. Sometimes people think 
that communicating is an HR hoaks but doing it even if it requires some
time and some patience can go a long way, preatty much always.
