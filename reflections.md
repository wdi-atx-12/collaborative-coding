### My Thoughts on Today's Pair Programming

I think what went well was getting to know what my partner was thinking.
Honestly, like dayummm. I can now see all the issues with my logic. I see a
whole new world now and it is as bright as the Sun except all it does is burn
sometimes. Anyways, seeing another perspective was my highlight from it. I think
we could have improved on not using coding words when trying to navigate the
driver. We could have used English and tried to get the other person to think?
I don't really have any complaints honestly. I've always had the hardest time
with my logic and objects. I think today improved it, but I definitely need to
hone my skills.

(Shhh... Funfunfunction is my life <3 Gotta love mpj)
Watching how these professional developers pair program together really shows
a different side of things. Not only do I learn how to build a Facebook Messenger
Bot, but I also get to see it being done like how it might be done in a start up.
So I like how they draw everything out before starting. They also pseudocode
before coding which is nice. I also learned no developer should be stuck on a
problem for more than 10-20 minutes. Also, explain what you're trying to do
before diving into your code.
