### the experience
Starting off the project as driver was *extremely* difficult. It probably sounds like I'm exaggerating but it's definitely in the top 5 of the most difficult tasks I have ever encountered. I'm aware that I'm not proficient in communicating effectively or efficiently in general and the deficiency made the task of **directing code even more challenging** since I needed to direct someone else, in this case, my partner Sofia, to do something I can't even convey or explain properly to myself.

I found it was most difficult to explain why I wanted to run a loop or call a function a certain way. My code seemed longer/more complicated to communicate than what my partner felt was a better way to write. There are many ways to do the same thing and we struggled to meet a middle ground at the beginning.

Sofia was great at pulling me back in when I was getting frustrated with driving. I was very clear that I knew I had a problem with verbal communication and asked for some patience. Sofia understood right away and worked really well around that. After some guidance from Chris, communicating and developing a 'big picture' plan helped us better understand and adapt to working together despite an obvious difference in the way we problem-solved.


It was a really great learning experience for a few reasons:
- I got to **learn about how I operate** as a team member and web developer, as well as see things from a different (my partner's) perspective.
- It was really awesome to **work together** with someone to achieve a mutual goal.
- It was awesome to organically **connect with another person** through a mutual interest.

### follow up research
By the end of the day and seeing the results, my interested was piqued. I read up on 2 articles:
- [pair programming (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
- [productivity tips from web developers... (usersnap)](https://usersnap.com/blog/productivity-tips-web-developers-manage-project-communication/)

##### terms i learned
*driver* vs. *navigator*
The driver writes code. The navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed and  "considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address" (wikipedia).
  - Different approach to pair programming from today but there's definitely something to take from this method.

##### tips/tricks to learn immediately
1. Improve on understanding myself/my logic when I'm coding, so I can communicate better with others.
  - I can actively translate between the style of code I like/am used to/makes most sense to me or the hybrid style I learned from working with Sofia (equally as intuitive after talking through it with someone) so that I can then use that skill to find which way works best with the function I'm creating or the bug I'm exterminating.
2. I can work on recognizing when I need to step away to decompress when I'm stuck and come back.

##### tips/tricks to use later
1. Adding any new recipes from using APIs, jQuery, etc.
2. Project planning!
