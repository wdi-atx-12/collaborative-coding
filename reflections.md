# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

 1.  The entire process is rather interesting and extraordinarily different to any way I have worked before. The collaboration was pretty interesting as well.  It made the entire process move along in a smoother than normal manner.  Carrington and I both agreed that we would not have been able to get the project complete in the ‘short’ time that we did.  It did not go so well as in that we had a hard time sticking to the ‘pair programming’ dynamic.  A few times she took over typing and inputting the code and a few times I went off and did my own code input without her guidance.  Jquery was the hardest part of our communication during this project, in my opinion, because of my current lack of knowledge on the subject.  I think that the pair programming exercise will be a great benefit in the job market.

2. I read “Costs, challenges, and common-pitfalls of pair-programming,” by Jameson Nyeholt.  The article confirms a few of my thoughts about the practice.  The amount of bugs decreased when this was implemented.  I can work on the “Watch The Master” syndrome, which is the more experienced coder takes over and runs the show.  I can see myself taking a back seat to a more experienced coworker.  I am a little timid about speaking up about a subject to someone that has been coding for a longer time than I have.  I do like the fact that the accountability is shared.
