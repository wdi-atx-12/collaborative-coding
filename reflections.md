# Memoirs of my 1st pair programming
### By Dazaev

## What went well:
Everything went pretty good. Jay, who I was working with did a great job.

## What went poorly
We just got stuck one time when we were trying to figure out how to take letters out off the whole km and city string, we couldn't remember what method to use at first but we got it done.

## Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? **Why?**
When we were trying to solve the problem that I mentioned above we kind of got stuck and I had trouble trying to interpret the instructions and display it on code.

## Which articles / blog posts did you read?
An article that talks about the importance of having a good environment between the whole team of devs and designers, how it helps when they're in constant communication between them. They mention getting rid of physical barriers between them helps a lot, they also mention how having a slack channel with everyone in it is clearly a must.

A lecture about the multiple benefits of pair programming, and I feel like this was the case for me today.

It talks about how having to work with someone else doesn't let you slack or get distracted. It helps the one who is talking to go through the logic part with ease and at the same time the one who is coding gets to see the way the other person solves the problem in a different way of doing every step in the process.

## Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?
I learned about a mental state called "Flow" which is when you're working in a steady good rhythm, avoiding any kind of distractions or anxieties.

## What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?
First off, I was really excited to work with APIs and had the idea of having at least one in my projects and Google Maps API was one of the first targets I had in mind, so I'm definitely using it later.

I learned how to get every piece of data I needed and use it to access more features and manipulate what they displayed to the user.
