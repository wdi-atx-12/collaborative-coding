1.Today's pair coding excersizes went fairly well. While the problems were relatively challenging to conceptualize,
there were almost no keypoints which detered us from advancing for too long. However, I remember getting the 
City and Country name from the database was particularly painful(Without the earthquake magnitude that is) due
to us accessing the wrong item in the json object that was returned. None of the code concepts were difficult to 
discuss, but it was sometimes difficult to communicate navigation to the typist(as a driver) and vice-versa. Overall
I'd say the experience was fruitful and a very satisfying way to put what we learned to the test.

2.I read an article by Agile Alliance that put into question and analyzed the pros and cons of pair programming. The 
article recognized the method's potential failure to return on its investment, but praised it for its potential 
benefits. A term came up in the article, ping-pong programming, in which the pair continuously switches roles 
between driver and navigator, almost at every little function or detail within a function. This process supposedly
keeps both members engaged, as well as increases the fluidity and cohesiveness between the two. Personally this is 
something that I would like to practice, since the Earthquake excersize felt as if it was long stretches of time
with one person dominating a role, only switching when fatigue demanded a switch in it. In summary, pair programming
requires engagement, concentration and experience to work well, yet despite its probability of ineffectiveness,
it results in higher quality code, a greater diffusion of understanding amongst team members,
and helps junior devs work with senior devs by virtue of sharing thought processes.
