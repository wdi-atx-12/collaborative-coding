# Reflections on Collaborative Coding



	Definitely the best part was having more than one pair of eyes. So at one point both me and Jesse got stuck, while we had our brain on over drive trying to figure it out Matt ended up pointing out something super simple and obvious that we had completely over looked trying to find the solution at a conceptual level. 

	I feel like the most difficult thing to communicate was my thought process going into a problem. When I was the person ‘driving’ and Jesse was typing we were definitely having a lot of trouble with getting in sync. Jesse seemed to want to immediately dive into coding while I tried to slow down the pace and try to verbally establish a plan before we got into coding. What ended up happening though is while I was sitting silent in thought Jesse would just take the initiative and start coding. After a while I gave up on my way of doing things and tried my best to match Jesse’s pace but we just ended up going back through the code because of little syntax error. Despite this though we were able to ultimately finish the project.

	   This article makes me realize I really should had been more vocal about when I was feeling pushed back but at the same time I also probably been more encouraging. At the end of the day honest we’re all here to try our best.
