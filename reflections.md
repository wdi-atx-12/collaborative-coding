## 1) Reflections on September 27, 2017 Pair Programming

Being paired with another web dev in training seemed daunting at first,
but it was great to see what a fellow classmate's skill set was made up
of as well as what was difficult. I think the biggest difficulty for us
was our combined lack of technical skill, which did not necessarily im-
pede our ability to meet the MVP, and also allowed us to work as a team
to help each other correct any syntax errors. I really enjoyed this exer-
cise.

### Thought's on Effective Navigation In Pair Programming

- The Navigator is the one taking instruction from the Driver
- A good Navigator should be concerned about the following:
    1. A clean and safe environment (physically)
    2. Providing a consistent environment (both physically clean 
       and in the design).
- Both the Nav and the Driver need to ensure that they share the same goals,
 as well as the same directives.
- "Lets start with a test for this" is actually some the Nav should say
- A good Nav will allow the driver some time to figure out any mistakes in 
 the code.
- A large number of interruptions due to unfamiliarity with the code may 
 indicate the need to switch roles.

### Thoughts on How to Become a Better Pair Programmer Part One

- States the need for standardizing tool configuration for more fluid
 communication and driving.
- Writer shares opinion that the driver should be the one to dictate the 
 tool choice.
