# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

Write your reflections here using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

## Strong Points

    - communicating thoughts/sequences to partner
    - coding partners ideas
    - supplementing each others ideas

### What went well

    - working out code in a step-wise manner together

### What went poorly

    - executing partners ideas well/drawing out the correct parameters from correct functions
    - working with coders weaknesses in coding

### Other thoughts

    - Overall the experience of Pair Programming is something that can be 
        highly effective when two or more partners have a strong idea of what 
        needs to be done as well as the technical skills to execute those plans.
        It can also be beneficial for a less experienced coder to work with 
        someone with a more advanced understanding of programming. Executing 
        the thoughts of the advanced programmer might illuminate more 
        effective ways of thinking for the junior partner. Unforturnatel,
        this could lead to an unbalanced work load for the advanced partner.
