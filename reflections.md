# Reflections on Collaborative Coding

Write your reflections here using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

#Reflect on today's pair programming and write out your thoughts.

1. What went well? What went poorly?

  - Matt and I worked well through the logic of what we needed to get done.
  We were able to talk through the whole lab at a pace we might not have separately.
  - As we reached roadblocks, we were not able to keep from both trying to see why it went wrong and it might have doubled our time looking at something

2. Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? Why?
  - Building the coordinates object
  - We both were not understanding how the code we were writing was spitting out information


3. Any other thoughts about the experience
  - I really enjoyed working with Matt and thinking through problems alongside him.
  I feel more comfortable about working on code with a team.


#Read up on a topic related to communication on a development team
#(e.g. pair programming, code reviews, Postmortems, etc) and write some thoughts about them


  1. Which articles / blog posts did you read?

    - https://www.sitepoint.com/work-effectively-in-a-web-development-team/

  2. Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?

    - You may not always be working on things you consider yourself good at or even like. "Teamwork is seldom found in what you think you are good at and feel good about. Stepping outside your comfort zone is the attitude that will challenge you and enable you to grow."

    - Going in the direction that may not have been your first instinct isn't a bad thing. Heading that way may teach you something new. "Just because it wasn’t your idea, it doesn’t mean it’s inferior."  

  3. What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately?

    - Being more open to going in different taking input on code while working with a team.


  4. What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?

    - Keeping an open mind and work out of my comfort zone
