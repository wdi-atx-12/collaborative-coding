-I felt like the paired programming exercise forced me to articulate my thoughts. In doing so it definitely gave me a better understanding of ajax and acquiring data from API's.

-Terminology was/has been difficult. Being able to point to a line or portion of code and explain what I'm trying to do or it function. When our code didn't work going back and trying to define what I thought should be change/corrected was a lot harder than expected.

-I thought the experience was overall positive. It further helped with the understanding of ajax and API's most definitely. I also enjoyed how paired programming forced you to think and operate not only about the task at hand but also how to work with someone else.

-I chose a blog post titled "3 Ways to Work More Effectively in a Web Development Team" on sitepoint.com

-I didn't learn or see any new terms, although they did reference Obi-Wan Kenobi!

-Communication and great attitudes are essential.It isn't always about coming up with the best idea rather how to best execute the best idea.

-Being able to take on a new program/task and realize that being able to adapt and learn will always be an important part of a developers career.
