##Reflect on today's pair programming and write out your thoughts.
Today's pair programming was an enriching experience that brought us from struggling on problems in a vaccuum (by ourselves) to facing them together with others attempting to learn.  While realizing how we could solve the problem we each learned ways to better work with each other and leverage each other's skills in a safe environment. 

###What went well? What went poorly?
Two of our three person group have had more experience than the other who is learning programming from scratch.   The most difficult problem that we had to solve involved me and the other prior experience team member going into deep dives of complex theory in how to attach function calls and parse through data to get the results we wanted.  We both assumed an early step had been completed successfully based on premature testing results.   The new programmer noticed the issue and tried to express it but was not confident enough to express the concern in a way that clicked for both of us as we were several thought steps ahead of him in our conversation while troubeshooting.  The end result, we (the advanced pair) mostly burned 30 minutes trying to solve a very simple issue (our original JSON return to set a few variables was still set to index[o] instead of index[i] in our loop).   If we had taken more time to listen to what the new programmer was trying to figure out or if he had had more confidence in asking the question we would have saved 30 minutes solving a seemingly impossible problem which was really just changing a '0' to an 'i'. 


###Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? Why?
I think our hardest concepts were those involving theory.  Because as each of us expained our theories we didnt really know if they'd work without testing them and we wanted to.  So we would need to gain buy in and concept from each other before taking a stab at a problem with our own original concept of how to approach the issue, and also from a place of not knowing if we were  picking the best possible route or what our partners may know that would be better. 

###Any other thoughts about the experience
3 was a little difficult to find roles with - we assigned the third person a role of process check and timekeeper to make sure we were staying on track and to alert us if/when we were running out of time or perhaps going on tangents. 

##Read up on a topic related to communication on a development team (e.g. pair programming, code #reviews, Postmortems, etc) and write some thoughts about them


###Which articles / blog posts did you read?
https://medium.com/@marlenac/the-moment-pair-programming-and-communication-23fb8676f1d2
I read "The Moment" by Marlena Compton who thoroughly captures the moment when we reach a brick wall while programming and how the pair programming technique helps us overcome and strengthen each other through those moments by encouraging communication and vulnerability to foster a dialogue that best leverages the team's skills as a whole. 

###Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?
I can't say that I have learned a new term as much as new concepts or revisiting concepts rather of fostering a safe environment that promotes team work.   To promote quality team work I think a safe and non judging environment needs to be established and understood by all team members.   That it's okay to admit when you're not sure of the next step and actually that admitting so should be celebrated in a sense, because it opens the door to empowering others to leverage their skills and have the group take turns learning from each other.  When someone is fully engaged in new material, it creates perhaps one of the best possible learning experiences and once an unclear piece of knowledge is understood by one team member, perhaps we can see other areas that that piece of knowledge was a predecer to unlock new thoughts that will eventually come back to benefit the team.    Another thing was learning about some remote teams use ot Team Speak channels (popular amongst world of warcraft / online gamers). 


###What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately?
I think admitting sooner when something is of challenge to me.  And to be more careful to take time to listen and also prompt responses from team members to check in if they think we are on the right track or what obstacles they may be experiencing.   By opening the lines of communication it's more likely that we will address our obstacles as a team rather than individuals and likely produce results faster and more effectively. 

###What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?
To not glance over someone's contributions or potential even if they are openly advertising that they have little understanding of what we're working on.  In today's exercise it was that individual who solved the most painful and longest to solve problem our group faced, because they were approaching the issue from a simple, starter point of focus that me and the other member had simply overlooked while going after deeper topics.
