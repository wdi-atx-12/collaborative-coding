## Pair Programming Postmortem
My partner Devin and I got pretty far together, accomplishing all but the last of the basic requirements. Even there we put together the code and probably would've gotten the custom icons to show with just a few more minutes.

Devin asked that I drive so that he could practice coding. I'll admit that the disparity in programming background made this a more natural fit. I'm curious what our experiences would've been had our roles been reversed.

Going through the code and commenting each block and function as Chris suggested was super helpful for Devin to keep track of what we had done. It was also helpful for me to understand his code as we have different coding styles.

Definitely the most difficulty was around navigating the code. I realized that my terminology, cribbed from 5 years of poring over documentation, may have been too high level. As Gerry suggested in an after-class conversation, sometimes just saying the line number is simpler.

Overall, I learned a lot from the experience and will definitely be asking potential employers whether they encourage pair programming.

## Dev Team Communication Research
I started by Googling ```dev team communication methodologies``` and [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/remote-teams) in the top results resonated with me immediately. My last employer allowed me to relocate from Austin to Houston on the condition that I engage regularly with coworkers online (many of whom were in Europe and Asia) and come in town for major meetings. However, I never felt I was fully integrated into the rest of the team, so this article on how Atlassian (I think originally an Australian company) implements Agile with remote team members seemed pretty relevant.

The term "distributed team" is interesting as it implies (and the article explicitly states) that "every team is remote" relative to every other team. It reminds me of how our class stays in touch via Slack into the evening, discussing the same project and problems, albeit separate codebases. It reminds me of when I would be up late attending meetings with colleagues overseas.

Creating a culture of videoconferencing/screensharing, overcommunicating decisions across teams, and rigorous definitions of when code is "done" were some of the specific strategies that I wish I'd employed at my last job. I see now that I was too accepting of the tremendous time and labor inefficiencies that plagued our team. There was and is a better way. And those same strategies will probably help for our group projects also.
